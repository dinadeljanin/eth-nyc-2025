# Project Overview
The Problem:

- Building hooks requires Solidity expertise
- Every team reinvents the same building block conditional logic
- No way to experiment without coding
- Complex integrations with oracles and cross-chain

Our Solution:
**Visual, drag-and-drop hook builder that generates actual Solidity contract**

# Executive Summary: Visual Hook Builder for Omnichain AMMs
We are building a no-code, visual programming platform that democratizes the creation of sophisticated Uniswap v4 hooks by combining Chainlink's real-world data feeds with LayerZero's omnichain messaging capabilities. Our drag-and-drop interface allows users to design intelligent AMMs that adapt to market conditions across multiple blockchains‚Äîautomatically adjusting fees based on Chainlink volatility data, coordinating liquidity strategies through LayerZero cross-chain communication, and implementing complex trading behaviors through visual decision trees. The platform then generates and deploys production-ready hook contracts to Unichain, transforming AMM development from a coding challenge into an accessible, visual design process that enables anyone to create market-responsive, omnichain-aware liquidity pools.

## Uniswap v4 Integration
Our platform directly addresses the core challenge of hook development by providing a visual interface for customizing swap fees, liquidity logic, and trading behavior. Users design conditional logic flows (e.g., "if ETH volatility exceeds 5%, increase fees to 1% and tighten liquidity ranges") through an intuitive graphical interface. The system then generates optimized Solidity hook contracts that implement beforeSwap, afterSwap, and liquidity management functions, pushing the limits of DeFi innovation by making advanced AMM strategies accessible to non-developers and enabling rapid experimentation on Unichain's high-performance infrastructure.

## Chainlink Integration
Our hooks natively integrate multiple Chainlink services to create market-responsive AMMs. We utilize Price Feeds for real-time asset pricing, Volatility Feeds for risk assessment across multiple timeframes (24h, 7d, 30d), Interest Rate Feeds for yield-aware strategies, and Chainlink Automation for scheduled rebalancing operations. Each hook contract actively calls Chainlink oracles to trigger state changes in pool behavior, with our visual interface pre-configuring these integrations as drag-and-drop modules. This multi-service approach directly qualifies for bonus consideration while making oracle integration accessible to all users.

## LayerZero Integration
We implement omnichain AMM coordination through LayerZero's OFT standards, enabling liquidity pools to share state and respond to cross-chain market conditions. When a hook detects high volatility on Arbitrum, it can automatically synchronize defensive mode across all chain deployments using LayerZero messaging. Our platform creates omnichain yield-bearing tokens that represent LP positions across multiple chains, allowing users to deposit on one chain while their liquidity actively manages risk across the entire multichain ecosystem. This eliminates liquidity fragmentation by creating unified, intelligent AMM behavior that transcends individual blockchain limitations, positioning our platform as critical infrastructure for the omnichain DeFi future.
