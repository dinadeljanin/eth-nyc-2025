# Task List: Hook Builder MVP Implementation
## Based on PRD: prd-hook-builder-mvp.md

## Tasks

- [ ] 1.0 Set Up Development Environment & Project Structure
- [ ] 2.0 Implement Core Hook Contract Infrastructure
- [ ] 3.0 Build Chainlink Integration Service
- [ ] 4.0 Create Hook Generation Engine
- [ ] 5.0 Develop API Layer & Frontend Integration Points
- [ ] 6.0 Implement Contract Deployment & Testing System
- [ ] 7.0 Create Demo Hooks & Final Integration

## Relevant Files

- `contracts/BaseHook.sol` - Base contract that all generated hooks will inherit from
- `contracts/VolatilityHook.sol` - Example volatility-based hook implementation
- `contracts/AstrologicalHook.sol` - Example astrological-based hook implementation
- `contracts/HookFactory.sol` - Contract factory for deploying custom hooks
- `services/chainlink.ts` - Service for integrating with Chainlink price and volatility feeds
- `services/hookGenerator.ts` - Template-based engine for combining pre-coded blocks and user parameters
- `services/deployment.ts` - Service for deploying generated hooks to testnet
- `services/hookCreation.ts` - Service functions for hook creation and management
- `services/deployment.ts` - Service for deploying generated hooks to testnet
- `types/hook.ts` - TypeScript interfaces for hook configurations
- `utils/validation.ts` - Validation utilities for hook configurations
- `config/networks.ts` - Network configuration for testnet deployment
- `scripts/deploy.ts` - Deployment script for testing hooks
- `tests/hooks.test.ts` - Unit tests for hook contracts
- `tests/services.test.ts` - Unit tests for backend services

### Notes

- Unit tests should typically be placed alongside the code files they are testing (e.g., `MyComponent.tsx` and `MyComponent.test.tsx` in the same directory).
- Use `npx jest [optional/path/to/test/file]` to run tests. Running without a path executes all tests found by the Jest configuration.
