# Product Requirements Document: Hook Builder MVP
## ETHGlobal NYC 24-Hour Hackathon

### 1. Introduction/Overview
The Hook Builder MVP is a visual, drag-and-drop platform that enables rapid creation of Uniswap v4 hooks by non-technical users. This tool democratizes DeFi development by allowing anyone to design sophisticated AMM strategies through an intuitive interface, then automatically generating and deploying production-ready Solidity contracts. The MVP focuses on volatility-based and astrological-based hook strategies, prioritizing a flashy demo that showcases the platform's potential to revolutionize how DeFi tools are created.

**Problem Solved:** Building hooks currently requires deep Solidity expertise, forcing teams to reinvent the same building blocks and preventing non-developers from experimenting with DeFi strategies.

**Goal:** Create a working prototype that demonstrates rapid hook creation for non-technical users, with a focus on visual appeal and immediate functionality.

### 2. Goals
- **Primary Goal:** Enable non-technical users to create functional Uniswap v4 hooks in under 5 minutes
- **Secondary Goal:** Demonstrate automatic Solidity contract generation from visual configurations
- **Tertiary Goal:** Showcase integration with Chainlink volatility feeds and basic astrological data
- **Success Metric:** Deploy at least 2 working hooks (volatility-based and astrological-based) to testnet within 24 hours

### 3. User Stories
- **As a hackathon judge**, I want to see a hook automatically adjust fees when ETH volatility exceeds 5% so that I understand the platform's real-time market responsiveness
- **As a non-technical user**, I want to drag and drop conditions and actions to create a hook so that I can experiment with DeFi strategies without coding
- **As a developer**, I want to see the generated Solidity code so that I can verify the platform produces production-ready contracts

### 4. Functional Requirements
1. **Visual Hook Builder Interface** - The system must provide a drag-and-drop interface for creating hook logic flows
2. **Condition Library** - The system must include pre-built conditions for ETH volatility thresholds and basic astrological positions
3. **Action Library** - The system must include pre-built actions for dynamic fee adjustment and basic trading behavior modification
4. **Real-time Data Integration** - The system must connect to Chainlink volatility feeds for ETH price data
5. **Code Generation Engine** - The system must automatically generate Solidity hook contracts from visual configurations
6. **Contract Deployment** - The system must deploy generated hooks to testnet for demonstration purposes
7. **Configuration Export** - The system must allow users to save and share hook configurations
8. **Basic Validation** - The system must validate hook configurations before generation to prevent deployment failures

### 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)
- **Complex UI Interactions** - Advanced animations, complex state management, or sophisticated user flows
- **Multiple Hook Types** - Focus only on volatility and astrological hooks for MVP
- **Production Security Features** - Advanced access controls, multi-signature deployments, or audit-level security
- **Cross-Chain Functionality** - LayerZero integration is lowest priority for MVP
- **Advanced Astrological Data** - Complex planetary calculations or extensive celestial event databases
- **User Authentication** - Login systems or user management
- **Hook Marketplace** - Discovery, rating, or sharing of user-created hooks

### 6. Design Considerations
- **Visual Appeal Priority** - Interface must look polished and professional for demo purposes
- **Intuitive Drag-and-Drop** - Users should understand how to build hooks without training
- **Real-time Feedback** - Show live updates as users configure conditions and actions
- **Mobile-Responsive** - Ensure the interface works well on various screen sizes
- **Modern UI/UX** - Use contemporary design patterns and smooth interactions

### 7. Technical Considerations
- **Frontend Integration** - Must provide clean API endpoints for the separate frontend team
- **Chainlink Integration** - Focus on volatility feeds (ETH/BTC) as essential data sources
- **Uniswap v4 Compatibility** - Generated hooks must follow v4 hook standards and interfaces
- **Testnet Deployment** - Use Sepolia or Goerli for demonstration purposes
- **Gas Optimization** - Generated contracts should have reasonable gas costs for demo
- **Error Handling** - Basic error handling for common failure scenarios

### 8. Success Metrics
- **Functional Hooks** - Successfully deploy 2 working hooks to testnet
- **Creation Speed** - Non-technical users can create hooks in under 5 minutes
- **Demo Impact** - Judges can clearly understand the platform's value proposition
- **Technical Validation** - Generated contracts pass basic compilation and deployment
- **Integration Success** - Chainlink volatility data successfully influences hook behavior

### 9. Open Questions
- **Frontend Integration Points** - What specific API endpoints does the frontend team need?
- **Astrological Data Source** - Where will we source basic astrological position data?
- **Error Handling Scope** - What level of error handling is sufficient for MVP demo?
- **Performance Requirements** - What response times are acceptable for hook generation?
- **Demo Scenarios** - What specific hook configurations will best showcase the platform's capabilities?

**Target Audience:** Savy finanical professional who understand Liquidity pools and cryptocurrency market effect but doesn't know Solidity or smart contract generation logic.

**Timeline:** 24 hours for MVP development and testing.

**Priority:** Focus on visual appeal and working functionality over advanced features or production readiness.
